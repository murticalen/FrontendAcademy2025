Demonstrate how we could utilise Panda to easily generate responsive layout and components with dynamic styles.

1. Use `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/` to fetch TODOs
2. Render previosly fetched todos in a layout of 3 columns on large desktop, 2 columns on medium desktop, and 1 column on mobile
3. Completed todos should be visually different from other non-completed todos
