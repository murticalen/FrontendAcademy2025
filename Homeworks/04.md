# Homework 04

Your first React homework is very simple - you have to add some functionalities to (at least) three existing files "Input.tsx", "Fetch.tsx" and "Messages.tsx". All files specify inside them what the task is.

The point of this homework is to practice useState and useEffect (+fetch). Do not feel the need to add anything fancy when it comes to styling and features, just complete the tasks.

Each task is worth 5 points, meaning you can get 15 points total from this homework.

## Extra info

The project was created with `yarn` and [Vite](https://vite.dev/). When you clone this homework, position inside `04` directory and run `yarn`. That will install all packages from the internet.

Once you have done that, you can run `yarn dev` inside the same directory and run the app. Once the app is running, adding changes will be visible in real-time, just like in the last lesson.

## Estimated duration: 30min - 3 hours, depending on your previous experience

## Deadline: March 26th, 9am
